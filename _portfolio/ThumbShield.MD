### Features

* Fully customizable fit with 8 points of measurement
* Absorbant Material with TPU 95A. All other thumb guards on the sports market are made from a cast. They are extremely hard and bruise the player's thumb on impact. My thumb guard absorbs the impact to keep the player on the field
* 1 Guard lasted me an entire 60+ game SEC college baseball season. Withstood 90+ mph fastballs
