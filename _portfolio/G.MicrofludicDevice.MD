### Goals

  Utilize the advanced high-resolution printing features of the Form 3 SLA printers available in the Digital Fabrication Lab to create practical microfluidic models. Teams of two will choose a specific microfluidic device and generate a mold using Fusion 360. Subsequently, the selected device will be molded with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and affixed to a glass slide using the created mold.

### What does this thing do?

A microfluidic mixing device serves the purpose of mixing small volumes of fluids. This technology is employed in various scientific, medical, and industrial applications where controlled mixing of liquids is required. In the scientific realm, microfluidic mixing devices find applications in research laboratories across disciplines such as chemistry, biology, and physics. These devices enable researchers to conduct experiments with minimal reagent consumption and offer precise control over reaction conditions.

In the medical field, microfluidic mixing devices are utilized in diagnostics, drug development, and point-of-care testing. They played a critical role in the advancement of at home COVID-19 tests. Furthermore, in industrial settings, microfluidic mixing devices are employed for various purposes, including chemical synthesis, quality control, and environmental monitoring. Industries such as pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and environmental management benefit from the efficiency, accuracy, and reduced waste associated with microfluidic technologies.

### Device and Applications

  I used 0.6 mm (60 microns) channels. Choosing a 0.6 mm channel for a microfluidic mixing device involves a careful balance between fluid dynamics, diffusion rates, and practical fabrication considerations. The selected channel width is designed to harness the advantages of microscale fluid dynamics, with the 0.6 mm size promoting laminar flow conditions that enhance mixing through diffusion. This choice strikes a practical balance, allowing for reliable fabrication while still utilizing the benefits of small-scale fluid mixing.
  Moreover, the 0.6 mm channel size takes into account the influence of diffusion as the main mixing mechanism for microfluidics. Smaller channels encourage more pronounced diffusion effects, contributing to efficient mixing over short distances. Beyond fluid dynamics, practical aspects such as fabrication ease.
  I utilized four (4) main mixing designs for the channels. Once the fluid is combined in the main channel after the y inlet, the first mixing device is a zig zag channel. A zigzag channel proves to be an effective method for fluid mixing in microfluidic devices due to its ability to enhance interaction between different fluid streams. The zigzag geometry amplifies the effective surface area where fluids come into contact, promoting interfacial mixing. Additionally, the zigzag pattern increases the effective length of the channel, providing fluids with extended residence time for enhanced interaction. The controlled turbulence generated by sharp turns in the zigzag channel disrupts laminar flow, further promoting fluid intermingling. 
	Next 2-lowercase j’s were used as intersecting channels. They represent the first letters of my partner, Jonah, and I’s first names. Other than aesthetics, the intersecting channels provide another mixing opportunity. Intersecting channels are a highly effective approach for fluid mixing in microfluidic devices due to their ability to promote extensive fluid interaction. These channels create multiple points of intersection, inducing high shear, collision, and increased diffusion at these junctions.
	The third mixing device was a channel with parallelogram barriers. The presence of these barriers induces controlled chaos, disrupting the smooth flow of fluids and enhancing the mixing process. The barriers act as obstacles, redirecting fluid flow and promoting collisions between different fluid layers, which significantly improves mixing efficiency. This approach is especially useful in applications requiring precise and rapid homogenization of components, such as chemical reactions and biochemical assays.
	The last mixing device was our 3D element. We used alternating vertical steps to enhance the mixing of the fluid. A 3D channel is a valuable approach for fluid mixing in microfluidic devices because it introduces an additional dimension to the fluid flow, enhancing the complexity of fluid interactions and promoting efficient mixing. Unlike traditional 2D channels, a 3D channel can incorporate features such as varying heights, like ours, that create intricate flow patterns and increase the probability of fluid streams intersecting and mixing. 

### Why Vat Photopolymerization? What is the main drawback?

  We chose to use vat photopolymerization to produce the microfluidic device mold because of its ability to achieve high-resolution printing, intricate details, and fine surface finishes. This 3D printing technique, which includes methods like stereolithography (SLA) and digital light processing (DLP), allows for precise control over the curing process of liquid resin layer by layer. This results in molds with smooth surfaces and accurate features, critical for microfluidic applications where channel dimensions and surface quality are paramount. 
  One of the main drawbacks of using vat polymerization to print a microfluidic mixing device is the challenge of incorporating Parylene, a common material for coating microfluidic channels. Parylene ensures the compatibility of the mixing device with various biological and chemical samples we might use. However, Parylene the coating process is difficult. It forms a uniform and thin coating on all surfaces, including the internal surfaces of microchannels. In vat polymerization-based 3D printing, it can be difficult to coat the internal surfaces of the printed microchannels with Parylene effectively, as the coating process is usually a separate step and may not reach small features in the printed structure. This limitation can impact the overall performance and compatibility of the microfluidic device, particularly in applications requiring specific surface properties within the channels. We had to print a second batch of microfluidic devices because the resin did not cure completely leading to the PDMS being stuck to the plastic. We think this happend because the photo initiator from the resin leaked into the PDMS and prevented it from fully hardening.

### Methods: 
Sketching in Fusion 360:
Use sketches to define the geometry of the microfluidic channels. Constrain sketches appropriately and add dimensions.
Label different components and features within the design.
Extrusion:
Extrude the 2D sketches to create the 3D model of the microfluidic device.
Adjust heights, widths, and depths based on design requirements.
Export STL File:
Export the 3D model as an STL file and import it to Formlabs to print. Ensure the bottom of the mold, which will contact the glass slides, is perfectly flat. Remember to align this surface parallel to the resin vat to prevent layer lines. This will mitigate any cupping warning during the print. 

PDMS Mixture:
Mix a two-part PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane) elastomer in the proper ratio.
Degas the mixture in a vacuum chamber to remove bubbles.
Pour PDMS into Mold:
Pour the degassed PDMS mixture onto the Parylene-coated mold.
Remove any remaining bubbles by gently tapping or using a vacuum chamber.
Cure PDMS:
Cure the PDMS in an oven or on a hotplate according to the manufacturer's instructions.
After curing, carefully peel the PDMS replica from the 3D-printed mold.

Plasma Bond Glass Slide:
Prepare Glass Slide:
Clean a glass slide thoroughly.
Optionally, treat the glass slide with oxygen plasma to enhance bonding.
Attach PDMS to Glass Slide:
Plasma bond the cured PDMS replica to the glass slide by exposing both surfaces to a brief burst of oxygen plasma.
Gently press the PDMS onto the glass to facilitate bonding.

Final Assembly:
Inspect and Test:
Inspect the microfluidic device for any defects or irregularities.
Test the device with appropriate fluids to ensure proper flow and mixing.
Finalize Labeling:
If needed, add any final labels or markings to the assembled device.
