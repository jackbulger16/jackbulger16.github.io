### Goals

  The goal of the iPhone bike mount project was four-fold. (1) To attach the holder to the handlebars. It was crucial that the holder securely clamps onto handlebars with a diameter of 23-25 mm or a size compatible with your bike, all without causing any damage like drilling holes or using set screws. (2) To attach your phone to the holder. It needed to grasp the phone firmly without obstructing any of its functions, such as access to the charge port or screen. (3) The holder's adjustability. It needed to lock the phone in either a vertical or horizontal orientation. (4) Choose 3D printable plastic that is both UV resistant and durable. This ensures the holder's longevity and resistance to outdoor elements.

### Design Features

  My design utilized three (3) 3D printed parts: a bottom handlebar attachment, a top handlebar attachment, and a phone holder. The handlebar attachments were made from PLA to create a strong and durable attachment to the bike. PLA also deforms easily when tightened, so it secured the phone mount without damaging the handlebars of my bike. The iPhone XR mount was printed in TPU. This is for two reasons. First, I needed the phone attachment to be flexible so I could easily slide my phone in and out of the mount. Second, I utilized a ball and socket joint to create 360 degrees of freedom with the mount. Without the ability to expand, the socket could not attach to the ball joint. TPU 95A provided a good mix of durability along with flexibility.

  In CAD I also used a top-down modeling approach for the first time. Top-down modeling in Fusion 360 offered several advantages. One of the key benefits is its ability to better control the entire assembly, as changes made to the top-level design automatically propagate down to the sub-components, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of errors. It also enables efficient parametric design, making it easier to explore various design iterations by modifying key parameters at the top level, thereby saving time. If I had to change a component, I could do it inside the file, instead of having to exit out and update the component in a separate file. Overall, top-down modeling is a powerful approach that enhances productivity and streamlines the design and development of complex products.

  I used two heat-set inserts and two (2) 20 mm M6 screws to attach the mount to the handlebars of my bike. The heat set inserts went into the top handlebar attachment. The bottom attachment had the screws and countersinks. As the screw tightened inside the heat set insert the plastic deformed and attached to the handlebars. I also used one (1) heat set insert to attach the phone mount to the handlebar attachments. At first, I put the heat set insert in the ball joint to secure the phone mount, I but decided to reprint the top handlebar attachment with the heat set insert in the bottom. Instead of a 10 mm M6 screw going halfway into the ball joint, now I have a 30 mm M6 screw that goes much farther into the design. It is much more secure. Finally, I have one (1) washer between the screw and the phone mount to increase tension, so the phone does not swivel on its own. The 30 mm M6 is tightened enough to hold the phone in place on its own but can be rotated by manually moving the phone.
