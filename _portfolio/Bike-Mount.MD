### Features

* Syringe pumps are motor-driven pumps capable of delivering a wide range of flow rates.
* There are many benefits of a syringe pump over a centrifugal or peristaltic pump. A few of these advantages are:
  * Sterility and minimal cross-contamination when swapping syringes 
  * Pumping of highly viscous fluids
  * High accuracy
  * Non-pulsatile flow
* Syringe pumps require only a handful of parts and rely on simple electronic control systems.
* Commercial variants can still cost several hundred dollars for entry-level models, so designing, 3D printing, and programming a syringe pump is a cost-effective alternative.
